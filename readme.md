# Connect Four Game

## Introduction
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a colour and then take turns dropping one discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid of size of your choice. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of your choice of one's own discs.

The game is finished as soon as one of the players satisfies the victory conditions. At that point the game can be restarted, or the players can return to the starting screen.

On the starting screen the players should be able to enter their names and select the Token (X, O) e.g. Player 1 with X, and Player 2 with O, or per your own choice).

The number of wins for each player should also be tracked. If the game is restarted, it should be reflected in the  by incrementing the number of wins for the winning player. If the players decide to return to the starting screen after the last round of the game, these values should be reset.

Round-end screen should clearly indicate the winner (if there is a winner), current score between the two players, and provide options for restarting the game or going to the start screen.
